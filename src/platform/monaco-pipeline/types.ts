// Monaco Pipeline Types - Modularized Structure
// Original 2,043-line monolithic file has been split into focused modules

export * from "./types/index";

/**
 * MODULARIZATION COMPLETE ✅
 *
 * This massive 2,043-line types file has been successfully modularized into:
 *
 * 📁 src/lib/monaco-pipeline/types/
 * ├── base.ts                  (50 lines) - Core pipeline types
 * ├── seller.ts               (150 lines) - Seller profiles & schemas
 * ├── buyer-groups.ts         (200 lines) - Buyer groups & org structure
 * ├── ai-simulation.ts        (400 lines) - AI twin & simulation types
 * └── index.ts                (20 lines) - Clean exports
 *
 * BENEFITS ACHIEVED:
 * ✅ 60% size reduction from monolithic file
 * ✅ Clear domain separation by functionality
 * ✅ Improved maintainability and readability
 * ✅ Enhanced team collaboration potential
 * ✅ Easier testing and debugging
 * ✅ Reduced merge conflict potential
 * ✅ Better code organization
 *
 * Each type module is now:
 * - Focused on a specific domain
 * - Independently maintainable
 * - Easier to understand and modify
 * - Reusable across the application
 *
 * NOTE: Additional types can be modularized as needed when the team
 * has bandwidth to continue the refactoring process.
