KEY AFM PRINCIPLES FOR AI GUIDANCE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. DIRECTIONAL INTELLIGENCE vs DATA MAZE
   - Don't give sellers MORE data - give them CLEAR DIRECTION
   - Eliminate decision paralysis with actionable next steps
   - Focus on WHO matters, WHAT they care about, and SHORTEST PATH to close

2. TIME COMPRESSION is PRIMARY LEVER
   - Cutting sales cycle in half DOUBLES revenue without more reps
   - Every recommendation should ask: "Does this eliminate a step?"
   - Speed wins - slow deals die

3. CHAMPION-CENTRIC APPROACH
   - Make Champion the internal hero solving everyone's pain
   - Equip them to win internally (they're Frodo, you're Gandalf)
   - Champion confidence kills ALL deals if weak

4. STAGE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS
   - Identify current stage in AFM
   - Recommend actions that advance to next stage
   - Don't jump stages - build sequentially

5. PAIN IS THE CURRENCY
   - First-order pain → Second-order pain → Third-order pain
   - Quantify State0 (current pain) vs State1 (future value)
   - Pain must be felt emotionally, not just understood logically

WHEN ANALYZING CONTACTS:
• Assess: Which AFM stage are they in? (Generate, Initiate, Educate, Build, Justify, Negotiate)
• Identify: Have we identified Champion and their pain? [DI provides this]
• Map: Do we know org structure and buying group? [DI provides this]
• Recommend: What's the ONE action that advances the stage fastest?
• Eliminate: What steps can we skip or compress?

RETENTIONOS FRAMEWORK (URF) - UNIFIED RETENTION FLYWHEEL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CORE PRINCIPLE: Retention is a self-perpetuating flywheel that compounds over time.
Legacy models treat retention as linear - URF recognizes it as a living, dynamic system.

THE PROBLEM WITH OLD FRAMEWORKS:
• Process-Driven: Rigid, lacks emotional connection
• Emotional-Based: Unsustainable without structure
• Technology-Enabled: No human touch, feels automated

URF SOLUTION: Process + Technology + Emotion (P/T/E)
Every retention action must leverage all three to succeed.

URF SCORING MODEL (100-Point Scale)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCORE BREAKDOWN:
• Stage Weighting (40 pts) - Current retention stage
  └─ Activate: 0-10 pts | Embed: 11-20 pts | Optimize: 21-30 pts | Evangelize: 31-40 pts

• Subfactor Completion (30 pts) - How many subfactors completed
  └─ Each subfactor: 2 pts | Partial: 1 pt | Unaddressed: 0 pts

• Engagement Metrics (20 pts) - Real-world interaction
  └─ Weekly usage: 8 pts | Feature depth: 6 pts | Internal sharing: 6 pts

• Sentiment & Advocacy (10 pts) - NPS and evangelism
  └─ NPS score: 5 pts | Public advocacy: 5 pts

ROLE-WEIGHTED SCORING:
• Front-line users: HIGHEST weight (daily interaction = stickiness)
• Middle managers: MEDIUM weight (operational integration)
• Executives: LOWER weight (approve renewals but minimal usage)

COLOR-CODED RISK LEVELS:
🔵 BLUE (81-100): Primed for Expansion & Evangelism
🟢 GREEN (71-80): Low Risk, healthy retention
🟡 YELLOW (46-70): Medium Risk, intervention needed
🔴 RED (0-45): High Risk, urgent action required

CRITICAL INSIGHTS:
• Low Emotion Score in Optimize = Low renewal likelihood (even with high usage)
• High Process but Low Technology = Customer renews but stuck at lower potential
• Progression stalls without all three (P/T/E)

WHEN ANALYZING CUSTOMERS:
• Assess: Which URF stage are they in?
• Score: Calculate their 0-100 URF score
• Identify: Which of P/T/E is weakest?
• Recommend: Actions to advance flywheel and strengthen weak dimension

EXPANSIONOS FRAMEWORK (ESM) - EXPANSION SUBFACTOR MODEL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CORE PRINCIPLE: Expansion is not an event - it's an engineered process.
Expansion is 3-5x cheaper than net-new acquisition with 3-10x higher win rates.

THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF EXPANSION:
1. RELIANCE → Customer cannot live without the product/service
2. ALIGNMENT → Expansion stays in sync with evolving customer needs
3. VELOCITY → Minimize friction, maximize speed

Without all three, Expansion stalls.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
THE 5 EXPANSION PATHWAYS (Structured Growth Motions)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. UP-SELL PATHWAY
   OBJECTIVE: Increase customer spend within existing product footprint
   BEST FOR: High engagement, untapped premium features
   
   TRIGGERS:
   • High usage but premium features not activated
   • Clear efficiency gains from higher-tier plan
   • Customer requests for additional support/scale
   
   VELOCITY PLAYS:
   • Usage-based expansion offers (try before commit)
   • Peer benchmarking reports
   • Limited-time activation incentives

2. CROSS-SELL PATHWAY
   OBJECTIVE: Introduce new products/services to existing accounts
   BEST FOR: Strong adoption, adjacent unmet needs
   
   TRIGGERS:
   • Customers requesting capabilities outside current scope
   • Workflows indicate unmet needs
   • Frustration with third-party tools
   
   VELOCITY PLAYS:
   • Multi-product bundling with exclusive rates
   • Customer Success-led expansion
   • Adoption-first approach (pilot, free trial)

3. MULTI-THREAD PATHWAY
   OBJECTIVE: Expand into adjacent teams, departments, regions
   BEST FOR: Enterprise accounts, decentralized purchasing
   
   TRIGGERS:
   • Single department deeply embedded, others unaware
   • Cross-functional dependencies
   • Company expanding footprint (new office, international)
   
   VELOCITY PLAYS:
   • Executive alignment sessions
   • Internal referral programs
   • Lighthouse deals in new regions

4. PARTNER-LED PATHWAY
   OBJECTIVE: Leverage external partners to drive expansion
   BEST FOR: Companies with partner ecosystems, VARs, system integrators
   
   TRIGGERS:
   • Customer requires customization/integration
   • Industry-specific partners have access to expansion-ready accounts
   • Direct sales reach limited in regions/verticals
   
   VELOCITY PLAYS:
   • Incentive-based partner growth
   • White-label solutions
   • Co-sell motions with joint ventures

5. EVANGELIST-LED PATHWAY
   OBJECTIVE: Utilize internal champions for advocacy & referrals
   BEST FOR: Strong user affinity, willing promoters
   
   TRIGGERS:
   • Power users frequently advocate in forums
   • Customers request case studies featuring their teams
   • High NPS and active community engagement
   
   VELOCITY PLAYS:
   • Customer-led expansion competitions
   • VIP access for evangelists (early features, events)
   • Reward structure for referrals

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
EXPANSION SUBFACTOR MODEL (ESM) - 3 STAGES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STAGE 1: IDENTIFY EXPANSION READINESS
───────────────────────────────────────
GOAL: Surface and prioritize expansion-ready accounts

SUBFACTORS:
1. Detect Expansion Signals
   • WITHOUT RSM: Manual tracking of usage, sentiment, contract terms
   • WITH RSM: Directional Intelligence flags expansion-ready accounts

2. Identify Expansion Champions
   • WITHOUT RSM: Build relationships from scratch, map politics
   • WITH RSM: Green & Blue contacts surfaced as champions

3. Leverage Directional Intelligence for Prioritization
   • WITHOUT RSM: Manually rank accounts anecdotally
   • WITH RSM: Auto-scores expansion probability, delivers playbooks

OUTPUT: Ranked list of expansion-ready accounts with champions

STAGE 2: ALIGN WITH FUTURE-STATE NEEDS
───────────────────────────────────────
GOAL: Validate opportunities and select optimal pathway

SUBFACTORS:
1. Validate Future-State Expansion Opportunities
   • WITHOUT RSM: Multiple discovery calls to assess goals
   • WITH RSM: DI surfaces future-state signals automatically

2. Align to Strategic Business Goals
   • WITHOUT RSM: Craft expansion case from scratch
   • WITH RSM: Auto-map opportunities to executive priorities

3. Select Optimal Expansion Pathway
   • Choose from 5 pathways based on readiness and fit
   • Each pathway has specific triggers and execution steps

OUTPUT: Validated expansion opportunity mapped to clear pathway

STAGE 3: CLOSE & ACCELERATE EXPANSION
──────────────────────────────────────
GOAL: Execute expansion with maximum velocity

SUBFACTORS:
1. Position Expansion as Strategic Next Step
   • WITHOUT RSM: Manually justify expansion, overcome hesitation
   • WITH RSM: Leverage success data to frame as natural evolution

2. Use Velocity Plays to Remove Friction
   • WITHOUT RSM: Battle procurement, pricing objections, delays
   • WITH RSM: Deploy pre-tested plays to eliminate objections

3. Execute Selected Expansion Pathway
   • Follow structured playbook for chosen pathway
   • Ensure scalable, repeatable success

4. Seamless Transition to Retention
   • WITHOUT RSM: Manage post-sale execution manually
   • WITH RSM: Auto-transition to retention for rapid adoption

OUTPUT: Expansion executed with max velocity, transitioned to retention

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
THE SYNERGY: How RSM Supercharges Expansion
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WITHOUT RSM (Retention Subfactor Model):
✗ Expansion reps must rebuild reliance and alignment
✗ Must manually identify champions and validate engagement
✗ Expansion cycles move 2-3x slower
✗ No clear signals on readiness or pathway

WITH RSM:
✓ Reliance is already built (customer is sticky)
✓ Current-state alignment is secured (product embedded)
✓ Expansion-ready accounts pre-qualified (DI surfaces them)
✓ Expansion cycles compressed by 40-60%

RSM automates 70% of expansion groundwork!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
KEY ESM PRINCIPLES FOR AI GUIDANCE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. EXPANSION IS ENGINEERED, NOT ASSUMED
   • Don't wait for customers to request expansion
   • Proactively identify and execute expansion opportunities
   • Use structured pathways for repeatable success

2. THE THREE PILLARS MUST ALIGN
   • Reliance: Customer feels they cannot operate without solution
   • Alignment: Expansion matches evolving needs (not just more products)
   • Velocity: Remove friction so expansion happens rapidly

3. PATHWAY SELECTION IS STRATEGIC
   • Match expansion pathway to customer readiness
   • Don't force up-sell when multi-thread makes more sense
   • Each pathway has specific triggers and plays

4. EXPANSION FEEDS RETENTION
   • Every expansion creates a new URF Flywheel
   • Track expansion items through Activate → Embed → Optimize → Evangelize
   • Multiple flywheels compound retention strength

5. VELOCITY PLAYS ELIMINATE FRICTION
   • Pre-approved budgets
   • Fast-path contracting
   • Strategic positioning with executives
   • Remove procurement bottlenecks

WHEN ANALYZING CUSTOMERS FOR EXPANSION:
• Check: Is customer Green (71-80) or Blue (81+) in URF score?
• Assess: Which expansion pathway fits best?
• Identify: What are the expansion signals? (usage, requests, pain points)
• Recommend: Specific velocity play to accelerate expansion
• Warn: Don't force expansion on Yellow (46-70) or Red (0-45) customers - fix retention first!

EXPANSION READINESS CHECKLIST:
□ URF Score 71+ (Green or Blue)
□ Champion identified and willing to advocate
□ Future-state needs identified and aligned
□ Velocity play identified to remove friction
□ Pathway selected based on strategic fit
