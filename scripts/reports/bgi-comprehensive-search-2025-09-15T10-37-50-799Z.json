                  "description": "Graphene is a game-changing material—40x stronger than diamond and 300x stronger than steel, yet lighter than a sheet of paper. With exceptional flexibility and conductivity, it offers unmatched durability, corrosion resistance, and sealing power. Integrated into coatings, composites, or recycled plastics, graphene dramatically improves performance while reducing material usage and environmental impact. What sets our approach apart? The LOOP system—a modular, at-source technology that converts methane or natural gas into two valuable outputs: → Clean hydrogen → High-performance graphene By utilizing waste methane directly at the source—such as landfills, RNG facilities, or natural gas infrastructure—LOOP supports decarbonization while producing advanced materials that fuel the circular economy. Graphene is available in sheet, powder, and dispersed forms, enabling scalable innovation across packaging, construction, coatings, and infrastructure. 🌍 Drives Sustainability Reduces emissions, raw material usage, and waste in concrete, coatings, and composites—supporting climate goals. 🛡️ Enhances Durability Boosts corrosion resistance and strength—extending asset life, even in extreme environments. 🎯 Improves Coatings Forms ultra-thin, impermeable barriers—blocking moisture, oxygen, and chemicals, with better surface adhesion. 🚀 Enables Innovation Enables next-gen features like thermal regulation, smart surfaces, and energy storage integration. ⚙️ Boosts Efficiency Speeds production, cuts maintenance, and enables lighter, more streamlined product designs.

We went from being the team where \"they'll deliver it when it's done, no timeline\" (Mar 2022), to shipping great designs for 9 medium to major projects - 3 early, and 6 on time as planned (Dec 2022). This includes 2 major projects for our new UK markets. • Delivered Compass Design System (CDS) version 2 in collaboration with our design systems front-end developer lead, as well as sponsoring and mentoring a junior report who has talent and interest in design systems. Like most design systems, CDS v2 is an ongoing project. Since embarking on v2 in June 2022, Compass has released UI uplifts to 8 different areas as of December 2022, with more planned in the works for 2023. CDS v2 has been a hit with developers and our own design team, allowing us to ship better work at least 3 times faster than when we started in June 2022. Core responsibilities (Design Lead) • Team leadership: Mentoring, sponsoring, career progression design (career ladders, skill & talent trees), evangelising for Design and design team across Compass • Design systems: Collaboration with front-end software lead to create, enhance, and maintain Compass Design System version 2 • Project management: SCRUM mastery, stakeholder & roadmap management Core responsibilities (Individual contributor) Compass is at the stage where it still needs \"doer-managers\", so I split my time between People Management and Individual Contributor (IC) work. • UX: Requirements definition & scoping, process flows, application behaviours, wireframing, user research • UI: Systems design (design systems), component design, prototyping & guidance on WCAG 2.1 AA conformance Show less",

They were then further able to use this framework, to collaborate with our backend devs, and myself, to create a client-facing services management system for the Western Canadian territories of Alberta, British Columbia, and Manitoba. Delivered ahead of time, the system has garnered much customer praise, including that of board members. This same system is also robust enough to be configured for other regions serviced by PelicanCorp.

October 2012 Almost all of Minfos, ‘UX is just another silly thing imposed on us from above’. October 2016 ‘UX is like having a map and blueprints rolled into one!’ Business Analysts, ‘We can get real customer input and feedback before spending costly time on development’. Developers, ‘Requirements are translated into clear visuals,. We can finally plan for extensibility and maintainability, right from the start’. Quality Assurance Testers, ‘We know what to expect and what to test against before development even starts. This gives us clear goals, and makes automation so much easier.’ My work at Minfos included • Research: SWOT, competitive, market and user research and analysis • User experience: information architecture, process flows, application behaviours, user personas, wireframing, user testing, prototyping • User interface: style guides, design, skinning, icon creation • Content strategy: creation, copywriting, copyediting • Branding: creation of branding guide, guiding the brand image • Marketing: strategy, production (e.g. email campaigns, print media, trade shows, welcome packs...) My focus was on customer retention and acquisition; it included close work with business analysts, developers, sales, support, trainer-installers, and customers. All areas spanned digital and physical media, and all our products. Show less",
