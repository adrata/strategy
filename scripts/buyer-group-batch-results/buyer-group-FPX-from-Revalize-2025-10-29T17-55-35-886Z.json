Liz has inspired so much of my output over the last 12 months; we should probably be sharing the byline. Her drive and diligence are inspiring, and her insight is invaluable. \n\nLiz is one of those people for whom going above and beyond is her natural state, and her industry experience and process-driven methodology are the backbone of our content calendar and prolific output. Friendly, open, and honest. Consistently motivated, professional, inspiring, and knowledgeable. I hope to continue to work with Liz and to support the sales process under her irreplaceable direction for many years to come.”",

Liz has inspired so much of my output over the last 12 months; we should probably be sharing the byline. Her drive and diligence are inspiring, and her insight is invaluable. \n\nLiz is one of those people for whom going above and beyond is her natural state, and her industry experience and process-driven methodology are the backbone of our content calendar and prolific output. Friendly, open, and honest. Consistently motivated, professional, inspiring, and knowledgeable. I hope to continue to work with Liz and to support the sales process under her irreplaceable direction for many years to come.”",

Emilia navigated me and the entire sales team through the hurdles a high-growth startup inevitably faces, and she displayed a level of empathy that is hard to find in leadership. Although I am early in my career, I feel I have gained a wealth of knowledge and experience because of the guidance Emilia provided me.
