        "aiReasoning": "Stig-Arne Ryeng is a Sales Executive at M-Files, which makes him moderately relevant for Sales Intelligence Software. As someone in a direct sales role, he would be a daily user and beneficiary of sales intelligence tools that provide lead data, account insights, and prospecting capabilities. His position suggests he's an individual contributor or mid-level sales professional rather than senior leadership, given the 'Sales Executive' title (not VP/Director). His strong LinkedIn presence (1,708 followers with 500+ connections) indicates he's well-networked and potentially influential among peers. In the buying process, he would most likely serve as a 'champion' - someone who recognizes the value of the tool through daily use and can advocate for its adoption to decision-makers. However, at M-Files (a document management software company), the final purchasing authority for a $150K deal would likely rest with a VP of Sales, CRO, or similar senior leader. His influence score of 6/10 reflects that while he can strongly advocate and influence the buying decision through bottom-up validation and demonstrating ROI, he probably lacks final approval authority for a deal of this size. He's relevant enough to engage as he could champion the solution internally and provide critical end-user feedback, but he should not be the sole contact for this opportunity.",

        "aiReasoning": "Jonathan Comer is an Account Executive in the Sales department at M-Files, making him highly relevant for Sales Intelligence Software. As an AE, he would be a direct end-user of sales intelligence tools to prospect, research accounts, and identify decision-makers. His role suggests he would benefit significantly from the product and could champion its adoption. However, several factors limit his decision-making authority: (1) As an individual contributor rather than sales leadership, he lacks budget authority for a $150K purchase, (2) At a company with 100 employees, purchasing decisions of this magnitude likely require VP/C-level approval, (3) While he can strongly influence the decision by demonstrating need and ROI from a user perspective, he's unlikely to be the final signatory. His value lies in being a potential internal champion who can advocate for the solution to leadership, provide use-case validation, and influence the evaluation process. His 500+ connections and 775 followers suggest he's well-networked and could facilitate introductions to decision-makers. Best approach: Position him as a champion who can help navigate to sales leadership (VP Sales, CRO, or CEO at this company size) who would ultimately approve the purchase.",

As an Account Executive in the Sales department, he is a direct end-user who will be heavily affected by Sales Intelligence Software implementation - this tool will directly impact his daily workflow, prospecting activities, and sales effectiveness. However, at the Account Executive level, he lacks the budget authority to approve a $150K purchase (decision-maker role) and isn't senior enough to be the primary internal advocate (champion role already filled by Stig-Arne Ryeng, likely a more senior operational leader). His involvement is critical for requirements gathering, user acceptance, and adoption success, but his influence is primarily at the user level rather than executive decision-making level.

          "aiReasoning": "Stig-Arne Ryeng is a Sales Executive at M-Files, which makes him moderately relevant for Sales Intelligence Software. As someone in a direct sales role, he would be a daily user and beneficiary of sales intelligence tools that provide lead data, account insights, and prospecting capabilities. His position suggests he's an individual contributor or mid-level sales professional rather than senior leadership, given the 'Sales Executive' title (not VP/Director). His strong LinkedIn presence (1,708 followers with 500+ connections) indicates he's well-networked and potentially influential among peers. In the buying process, he would most likely serve as a 'champion' - someone who recognizes the value of the tool through daily use and can advocate for its adoption to decision-makers. However, at M-Files (a document management software company), the final purchasing authority for a $150K deal would likely rest with a VP of Sales, CRO, or similar senior leader. His influence score of 6/10 reflects that while he can strongly advocate and influence the buying decision through bottom-up validation and demonstrating ROI, he probably lacks final approval authority for a deal of this size. He's relevant enough to engage as he could champion the solution internally and provide critical end-user feedback, but he should not be the sole contact for this opportunity.",

As an AE, he would be a direct end-user of sales intelligence tools to prospect, research accounts, and identify decision-makers. His role suggests he would benefit significantly from the product and could champion its adoption. However, several factors limit his decision-making authority: (1) As an individual contributor rather than sales leadership, he lacks budget authority for a $150K purchase, (2) At a company with 100 employees, purchasing decisions of this magnitude likely require VP/C-level approval, (3) While he can strongly influence the decision by demonstrating need and ROI from a user perspective, he's unlikely to be the final signatory. His value lies in being a potential internal champion who can advocate for the solution to leadership, provide use-case validation, and influence the evaluation process. His 500+ connections and 775 followers suggest he's well-networked and could facilitate introductions to decision-makers. Best approach: Position him as a champion who can help navigate to sales leadership (VP Sales, CRO, or CEO at this company size) who would ultimately approve the purchase.",

However, at the Account Executive level, he lacks the budget authority to approve a $150K purchase (decision-maker role) and isn't senior enough to be the primary internal advocate (champion role already filled by Stig-Arne Ryeng, likely a more senior operational leader). His involvement is critical for requirements gathering, user acceptance, and adoption success, but his influence is primarily at the user level rather than executive decision-making level.
