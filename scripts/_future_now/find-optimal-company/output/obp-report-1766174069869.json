  "internalDialogue": "# INTERNAL MEETING SCENE\n\n**SETTING:** Nike's main conference room, Tuesday 2:47 PM. Sarah Chen sits across from David Kim (CTO) for their bi-weekly check-in. Sarah has a notebook filled with metrics and a laptop showing compliance spreadsheets.\n\n**SARAH:** David, I wanted to walk through our SOC 2 timeline. Based on what I'm seeing, we're looking at 12-18 months if we continue manually collecting evidence and managing controls.\n\n**DAVID:** [Thinking: That seems long, but Sarah knows this stuff] Okay, break that down for me. What's driving that timeline?\n\n**SARAH:** [Internal panic: I have 45 days left to prove I can handle this role] Right now we have two engineers spending about 60% of their time just on evidence collection. Screenshot compliance, manual policy updates, chasing down access reviews. At Stripe, our security-to-engineer ratio was about 1:12. Here we're at 1:25, and that gap is showing. [Thinking: I can't say \"we're behind every benchmark I know\" but we really are]\n\n**DAVID:** [Thinking: She keeps referencing Stripe. I need to know if she can work with our constraints, not just compare us to a public company] Look, I get that you had more resources there, but we're series B. We need to be scrappy. Can't we build some automation ourselves? Maybe a simple dashboard that pulls from our existing tools?\n\n**SARAH:** [Thinking: Here's the engineering mindset - build vs buy. But I've seen this movie] I ran those numbers. Custom building would take Marcus and Jenny about 4-5 months just for basic evidence automation, and that's assuming no other security incidents. Then we still need ongoing maintenance, integrations with new tools as we scale... [Pausing] And honestly, that timeline puts my SOC 2 commitment to the board at risk.\n\n**DAVID:** [Thinking: Board commitment. That's the real pressure here] What kind of risk are we talking about?\n\n**SARAH:** [Internal stress: This is my prove-it moment] The Q4 enterprise deals Lisa's team is chasing - three of them explicitly mentioned SOC 2 as table stakes. If we push this to Q2 next year, that's potentially $2M in delayed revenue. [Thinking: I know the solution exists, I just need him to see we can't DIY our way out of this one]\n\n**DAVID:** [Thinking: Now we're talking business impact, not just security nice-to-haves] So what are you proposing?\n\n**SARAH:** I've been researching compliance automation platforms. Something that can integrate with our current stack, automate the evidence collection, and give us continuous monitoring instead of these manual point-in-time assessments. [Thinking: Please don't ask me to build this from scratch when specialized tools exist] The ROI is pretty clear when you factor in the FTE time we'd save plus faster time to compliance.\n\n**DAVID:** [Thinking: She's learned to speak in ROI, that's good. But I need to know this integrates well and doesn't create technical debt] Show me the technical specs on what you're evaluating. I want to make sure whatever we choose plays nicely with our existing infrastructure and doesn't become another vendor management headache.\n\n**SARAH:** [Thinking: He's moving from \"if\" to \"what\" - that's progress] Absolutely. Let me put together a technical evaluation with integration requirements and we can review later this week?\n\n**DAVID:** Do it. And Sarah? Include the comparison to building internally. I need to justify this to the board as the right technical decision, not just the fast one.",
