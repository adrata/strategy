  "internalDialogue": "Scene: Weekly executive meeting at Example Company, 45 days after Sarah Chen joined as Head of Security\n\nCTO: Sarah Chen, the board is asking about our security compliance timeline. Where are we?\n\nSARAH [internal]: At Stripe we had 1:40 to 1:67 security ratio. Here it's 1:88. There's no way we hit our goals with this team size.\n\nSARAH: We're making progress, but I have to be honest - my team is stretched thin. We're supporting 350 people with 4 security engineers. At Stripe, that ratio was 3x better.\n\nCTO: We can't hire more headcount right now - we committed to 18-month runway.\n\nSARAH [internal]: This is the moment. I either fight for tools or drown in manual work. I've seen this work before - I know what's possible.\n\nSARAH: I'm not asking for headcount. At Stripe, we used automation to do 80% of compliance evidence collection. One platform replaced what would have been 2-3 full-time people. The math works out to significant savings versus hiring.\n\nCTO: What's the platform cost?\n\nSARAH: About $50K annually. Net savings of $100K+, plus we actually hit our deadline.\n\nCEO: And this worked at Stripe?\n\nSARAH: We got SOC 2 Type II in 4 months. Companies doing it manually take 12-18 months.\n\nCTO: Put together a proposal. I want to see the ROI breakdown.",
