  "internalDialogue": "## SCENE: Conference Room B - Weekly Security Review\n*Wednesday, 2:47 PM. Sarah Chen sits across from Marcus Rivera (CTO) and Lisa Park (VP Engineering). Laptops open, coffee getting cold.*\n\n**SARAH:** So we're at 72% completion on our SOC 2 readiness assessment. [God, this is painful. At Stripe we would have been done by now.] The challenge is evidence collection - we're manually screenshotting access logs, chasing down policy acknowledgments from different teams...\n\n**MARCUS:** That's progress though, right? We're ahead of where most Series B companies are. [Sarah seems stressed. Maybe the transition is harder than we thought.]\n\n**SARAH:** Marcus, we're burning 15-20 hours a week on compliance grunt work. That's half my team's capacity. [I have 45 days left to prove I can scale this properly. This manual approach will kill us.] And when we get our first enterprise prospect asking for SOC 2 Type II...\n\n**LISA:** How long until we're compliant?\n\n**SARAH:** At this pace? 12-18 months for the full cycle. [This is embarrassing. I need to say something.] Look, I've been through this before. There are platforms that can automate 80% of this compliance work - continuous evidence collection, automated policy workflows...\n\n**MARCUS:** [Here we go. Another tool purchase.] Hold on. Can't we build some internal scripts? Maybe integrate with our existing monitoring stack? I don't love adding another vendor when we're trying to show path to profitability.\n\n**SARAH:** [He's thinking like an engineer, not a business leader.] I get the build-versus-buy instinct. But Marcus, think about the opportunity cost. [Deep breath. Make this about business impact, not technical elegance.] Every week my team spends taking screenshots is a week we're not hardening our infrastructure or building security into the product. \n\n**LISA:** What's the business case?\n\n**SARAH:** Revenue enablement. Our biggest pipeline deals are asking for SOC 2. Sales told me we've already had two prospects push because we couldn't provide compliance documentation. [This is my moment.] If we can get compliant in 4 months instead of 18, that's potentially millions in revenue we can close this year.\n\n**MARCUS:** [Damn. She's right about the revenue impact.] What kind of platforms are you talking about?\n\n**SARAH:** [Finally.] Automated compliance platforms - they integrate with our existing tools, continuously collect evidence, manage the audit process. Think of it as infrastructure for trust, not just another security tool.\n\n**MARCUS:** Send me some options. Let's see what the integration story looks like and what this costs us versus building internally.\n\n**SARAH:** [Victory. Small, but I'll take it.] I'll have a brief on your desk by Friday.",
