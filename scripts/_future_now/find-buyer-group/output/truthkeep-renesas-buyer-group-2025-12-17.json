            "description": "Buyers increasingly demand business case justification for AI semiconductor investments, but Jinyoung lacks tools to calculate and demonstrate tangible ROI based on performance improvements, power savings, and deployment costs. This is particularly challenging when selling complex AI solutions where benefits materialize across multiple business units and use cases.",
