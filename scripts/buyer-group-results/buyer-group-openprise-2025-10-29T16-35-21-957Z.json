You name the medium and she created compelling content for it: blogs, customer stories, guides, thought leadership reports, video scripts, PR articles, ads, web pages, sales sequences, etc. But I quickly realized her skills extend far beyond writing. In the 3 years we worked together, we scaled the content marketing function as a whole and built a well-oiled machine. \n\nShe single-handedly ran Beekeeper's social media and blog, as well as spearheaded critical projects like SEO and refreshing/optimizing older content on a weekly cadence that gave us a massive boost in conversion rates. She is wildly creative, but also prioritizes optimization/performance and kept her finger on the pulse of our analytics. And as far as soft skills go, she's a collaborative team player with enormous grit. She's not afraid to take an idea with little direction and create/own the whole process. I would hire her again in a second, best decision I ever made as a manager!”",

You name the medium and she created compelling content for it: blogs, customer stories, guides, thought leadership reports, video scripts, PR articles, ads, web pages, sales sequences, etc. But I quickly realized her skills extend far beyond writing. In the 3 years we worked together, we scaled the content marketing function as a whole and built a well-oiled machine. \n\nShe single-handedly ran Beekeeper's social media and blog, as well as spearheaded critical projects like SEO and refreshing/optimizing older content on a weekly cadence that gave us a massive boost in conversion rates. She is wildly creative, but also prioritizes optimization/performance and kept her finger on the pulse of our analytics. And as far as soft skills go, she's a collaborative team player with enormous grit. She's not afraid to take an idea with little direction and create/own the whole process. I would hire her again in a second, best decision I ever made as a manager!”",

In the 2+ years I had the privilege of working with Jessica at Beekeeper she was always thinking outside the box and challenging us to do more and more exciting and new things! Beekeeper would truly not be where it is today without her selfless dedication to her craft and her impeccable ability to develop and create content that is not only engaging but enriching to the targeted audience.
