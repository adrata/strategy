# Ross Workspace Display Fix Instructions

## Problem Solved
Ross's `activeWorkspaceId` has been updated in the database from Notary Everyday to Adrata, but the left panel was still showing Notary Everyday data due to cached session and localStorage data.

## What Was Fixed
✅ **Database Updated**: Ross's `activeWorkspaceId` changed to Adrata workspace  
✅ **Server Cache Cleared**: All server-side counts cache has been cleared  
✅ **Role Updated**: Ross changed from SUPER_ADMIN to WORKSPACE_ADMIN (like Dan)

## What Ross Needs to Do

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache
Ross needs to clear his browser's localStorage cache to see the correct workspace data:

#### Option A: Use Developer Tools (Recommended)
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
3. Find **Local Storage** in the left sidebar
4. Look for entries starting with `adrata-fast-counts-`
5. Delete all entries that contain `notary-everyday` or old workspace IDs
6. Refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

#### Option B: Use Console Script
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Copy and paste this script:

```javascript
// Clear Adrata workspace cache
console.log('🧹 Clearing Adrata workspace cache...');
const keysToRemove = [];
for (let i = 0; i < localStorage.length; i++) {
  const key = localStorage.key(i);
  if (key && (
    key.startsWith('adrata-fast-counts-') ||
    key.includes('notary-everyday') ||
    key.includes('01K7DNYR5VZ7JY36KGKKN76XZ1')
  )) {
    keysToRemove.push(key);
  }
}
keysToRemove.forEach(key => {
  localStorage.removeItem(key);
  console.log(`✅ Removed: ${key}`);
});
console.log(`🧹 Cleared ${keysToRemove.length} cache entries`);
console.log('🔄 Please refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)');
```

4. Press Enter
5. Refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

#### Option C: Clear All localStorage (Nuclear Option)
If the above doesn't work:
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Type: `localStorage.clear()`
4. Press Enter
5. Refresh the page

### Step 2: Verify the Fix
After clearing cache and refreshing, Ross should see:
- ✅ **Adrata workspace data** in the left panel
- ✅ **Correct counts** for Adrata workspace (not Notary Everyday)
- ✅ **No more Notary Everyday data** anywhere
- ✅ **Same role as Dan** (WORKSPACE_ADMIN)

## Technical Details
- **Database**: Ross's `activeWorkspaceId` = `01K7464TNANHQXPCZT1FYX205V` (Adrata)
- **Role**: Changed from `SUPER_ADMIN` to `WORKSPACE_ADMIN`
- **Server Cache**: Cleared via `/api/data/counts` POST endpoint
- **Client Cache**: Needs to be cleared manually in browser

## If Issues Persist
If Ross still sees Notary Everyday data after following these steps:
1. Try signing out and signing back in
2. Check that the URL shows the correct workspace
3. Contact the development team with specific error messages
