# TypeScript Standards

## Type Safety
- Use strict TypeScript configuration with `noImplicitAny: true`
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary - use `unknown` instead
- Use proper type annotations for function parameters and return types
- Leverage TypeScript's strict null checks and handle null/undefined explicitly
- Use type guards and assertion functions for runtime type checking

## Code Organization
- Use named exports over default exports for better tree-shaking
- Group imports: external libraries, internal modules, relative imports
- Use absolute imports with `@/` prefix for internal modules
- Keep functions small and focused (max 50 lines)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Error Handling
- Use Result/Either patterns for error handling instead of throwing exceptions
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Use Zod for runtime validation and type inference
- Log errors with structured logging and include context

## Performance
- Use `React.memo()` for expensive components
- Implement proper dependency arrays in hooks
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` judiciously
- Avoid creating objects/functions in render methods

## Modern TypeScript Features
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`)
- Leverage template literal types for type-safe string manipulation
- Use const assertions for immutable data structures
- Implement proper generic constraints and variance

## Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Use JSDoc comments for complex functions and public APIs
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for types)
- Keep cyclomatic complexity low (max 10 per function)
