<h1>The Greatest Salespeople in History</h1>
<p class="subtitle">The stories. The hooks. The lessons.</p>

<div class="quote">
    "Everyone lives by selling something."
    <cite>— Robert Louis Stevenson</cite>
</div>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h2>The Pioneers</h2>
<!-- ============================================== -->

<div class="person">
    <div class="name">John Henry Patterson</div>
    <div class="title">Founder, NCR | 1844-1922</div>
    <div class="hook">In 1884, salesmen were seen as con artists. By 1920, they ran America's biggest companies. One man changed everything.</div>
    <div class="story">
        Patterson bought a failing cash register company. His salesmen were untrained, unscripted, and unpredictable. Sales were random. So he did something radical: he wrote a script. Every word. Every gesture. Every objection handled.
        <br><br>
        He built a "sales school" where reps practiced until perfect. He invented territories, quotas, and sales conventions. He was fired for being too controlling—twice.
        <br><br>
        But here's what matters: Thomas Watson Sr. (IBM), Charles Kettering (Delco), and 50+ future CEOs all trained under Patterson. He didn't just build a company. He built a profession.
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
        <strong>The Lesson</strong>
        <p>Selling can be taught. Script it. Practice it. Perfect it.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="person">
    <div class="name">Thomas Watson Sr.</div>
    <div class="title">Founder of IBM | 1874-1956</div>
    <div class="hook">He was fired at 40. Then he built the most valuable company in the world.</div>
    <div class="story">
        Watson learned everything at NCR under Patterson. They had a falling out. Watson was fired.
        <br><br>
        At 40, he joined a tiny company called Computing-Tabulating-Recording. He renamed it IBM. And he did one thing differently: his salesmen didn't pitch products. They solved problems.
        <br><br>
        "THINK" signs hung in every office. Dark suits. White shirts. Perfect posture. IBM salesmen didn't look like salesmen. They looked like executives. Because that's who they were selling to.
        <br><br>
        The result? IBM dominated computing for 50 years. Not because of better technology. Because of better selling.
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
        <strong>The Lesson</strong>
        <p>Look like your customer. Think like your customer. Be the advisor, not the vendor.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="person">
    <div class="name">Elmer Wheeler</div>
    <div class="title">"America's Greatest Salesman" | 1903-1968</div>
    <div class="hook">He tested 105,000 phrases on 19 million customers. Then he found the 5 words that changed everything.</div>
    <div class="story">
        Wheeler was obsessed with one question: What words actually work?
        <br><br>
        He tested everything. Headlines. Openers. Closes. Objection handlers. On 19 million real customers. The data revealed patterns nobody expected.
        <br><br>
        His most famous finding: "Don't sell the steak—sell the sizzle."
        <br><br>
        Emotion beats logic. Every time. Woolworth's implemented his phrases and saw 300% sales increase. His book sold millions. All from testing words.
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
        <strong>The Lesson</strong>
        <p>Sell the sizzle, not the steak. Test your words. The right phrase can 10x results.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<h2>The Record Breakers</h2>
<!-- ============================================== -->

<div class="person">
    <div class="name">Joe Girard</div>
    <div class="title">Guinness World Record Holder | 1928-2019</div>
    <span class="stat">13,001 cars sold</span>
    <span class="stat">6 per day average</span>
    <div class="hook">Most car salesmen sell 10 cars a month. Joe Girard sold 6 per day. For 15 years straight. His secret cost $0.50 per customer.</div>
    <div class="story">
        Girard sent 13,000 greeting cards every month. Birthday cards. Holiday cards. "I like you" cards. Just because.
        <br><br>
        Every customer got a handwritten note. Every buyer got a follow-up call. Every referral got a thank you.
        <br><br>
        He called it "Girard's Law of 250": Every person knows 250 people who might attend their wedding or funeral. Win one customer, impress them, you have access to 250 more. Disappoint one, 250 hear about it.
        <br><br>
        13,001 cars. One relationship at a time.
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
        <strong>The Lesson</strong>
        <p>Every customer is worth 250 referrals. Treat them that way.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="person">
    <div class="name">Ben Feldman</div>
    <div class="title">New York Life Insurance | 1912-1993</div>
    <span class="stat">$1.8 billion in policies</span>
    <div class="hook">He was 5'4" with a lisp. He worked in a town of 20,000 people. He outsold 1,500 of the company's 1,800 offices. Combined.</div>
    <div class="story">
        East Liverpool, Ohio. Population 20,000. No skyscrapers. No Fortune 500 companies. Just Ben Feldman, selling life insurance.
        <br><br>
        He didn't sell policies. He sold fear. Specific, vivid fear.
        <br><br>
        "What happens to your family at 8am Monday if you don't come home Sunday night?"
        <br><br>
        He worked 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year, for 50 years. When asked his secret, he said one word: "Work."
        <br><br>
        In his peak years, he sold more than entire agencies in New York and Chicago. From a town smaller than most suburbs.
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
        <strong>The Lesson</strong>
        <p>Sell the pain of not buying. Make them feel the consequences of inaction.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="person">
    <div class="name">Erica Feidner</div>
    <div class="title">"The Piano Matchmaker" | 1990s-2000s</div>
    <span class="stat">$150,000+ average sale</span>
    <div class="hook">She sold $150,000 pianos to the world's pickiest customers. Her sales pitch? She didn't have one.</div>
    <div class="story">
        Concert pianists will play the same instrument for 40 years. They don't buy a piano. They marry one.
        <br><br>
        Feidner understood this. She never pitched. Never pushed. Never mentioned price until asked. She let musicians play every piano in the showroom. For hours. For days. For weeks.
        <br><br>
        She called herself a "matchmaker." Her job wasn't selling. It was listening.
        <br><br>
        Billy Joel. Lang Lang. Symphony orchestras. They all bought from Erica. Because she found them the one.
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
        <strong>The Lesson</strong>
        <p>For major purchases, be a matchmaker. Help them find what they already want.</p>
    </div>

<h2>The Door-to-Door Legends</h2>
<!-- ============================================== -->

<div class="person">
    <div class="name">Alfred Fuller</div>
    <div class="title">Founder, Fuller Brush Company | 1885-1973</div>
    <span class="stat">25,000 salespeople at peak</span>
    <div class="hook">He couldn't hold a job. He failed at everything. So at 21, he started making brushes in his basement. Then he knocked on every door in Boston.</div>
    <div class="story">
        Fuller had a problem: nobody wanted to buy brushes from a stranger.
        <br><br>
        So he gave them away. A free brush at every door. Whether they bought or not.
        <br><br>
        The gift created obligation. The demonstration created desire. The follow-up created sales.
        <br><br>
        "The Fuller Brush Man" became an American icon. 25,000 salespeople. $130 million in revenue. All from giving before asking.
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
        <strong>The Lesson</strong>
        <p>Give before you ask. A free sample opens every door.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="person">
    <div class="name">Anna Bissell</div>
    <div class="title">First Female CEO of a Major Corporation | 1846-1934</div>
    <div class="hook">Her husband invented the carpet sweeper. Then he died. At 43, she became America's first female CEO. Her competitors said she'd fail within a year.</div>
    <div class="story">
        1889. Women didn't run companies. They weren't supposed to.
        <br><br>
        Anna Bissell didn't care. She'd been selling sweepers door-to-door alongside her husband for years. She knew the business better than anyone.
        <br><br>
        Her secret: never explain what the product does. Show it. She'd walk into a home, sweep the carpet in front of them, and let the results speak.
        <br><br>
        She expanded to Europe. She opened factories. The brand still exists 130 years later. All because she understood: demonstration beats explanation.
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
        <strong>The Lesson</strong>
        <p>Show, don't tell. A demonstration is worth a thousand words.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="person">
    <div class="name">David H. McConnell</div>
    <div class="title">Founder, Avon | 1858-1937</div>
    <span class="stat">6 million salespeople today</span>
    <div class="hook">He was a door-to-door book salesman who couldn't sell books. So he gave away free perfume samples. The samples outsold the books. He never sold another book again.</div>
    <div class="story">
        McConnell noticed something strange: housewives didn't want his books. They wanted the free perfume he gave with each purchase.
        <br><br>
        So he switched. But he had another insight: women trusted other women. Especially in 1886, when inviting a male stranger into your home was unusual.
        <br><br>
        He hired women. Only women. Called them "Avon Ladies."
        <br><br>
        Today: 6 million Avon representatives worldwide. One of the largest sales forces in history. All because he listened to what customers actually wanted.
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
        <strong>The Lesson</strong>
        <p>Hire people who look like your customers. Trust is easier when the seller feels familiar.</p>

    <span class="stat">First female millionaire</span>
    <span class="stat">20,000+ sales agents</span>
    <div class="hook">Born to former slaves. Orphaned at 7. Widowed at 20. Earning $1.50/day as a washerwoman. She became the first self-made female millionaire in American history. Here's how.</div>
    <div class="story">
        Sarah Breedlove was losing her hair. Stress. Malnutrition. Bad products. She experimented until she found formulas that worked.
        <br><br>
        Then she sold them. Door-to-door. Demonstrating on herself. Telling her own story.
        <br><br>
        She didn't just sell hair care. She sold transformation. She sold hope. She sold "if I can do it, you can too."
        <br><br>
        She built a network of 20,000+ "Walker Agents"—Black women selling to Black women. She made them financially independent. She changed their lives.
        <br><br>
        When she died at 51, she was worth over $1 million. Today that's $15 million. All from a $1.50/day washerwoman.

    <span class="stat">Pink Cadillacs</span>
    <div class="hook">At 45, she was passed over for promotion. The job went to a man she had trained. She quit. Then she built a $3 billion empire to prove them wrong.</div>
    <div class="story">
        Mary Kay spent 25 years in direct sales. She was good. Really good. But the men kept getting promoted over her.
        <br><br>
        So she retired and wrote a book about her dream company. Then she realized: why not just build it?
        <br><br>
        With $5,000, she started Mary Kay Cosmetics. Her philosophy: "God first, family second, career third." And: "Praise people to success."
        <br><br>
        The pink Cadillacs weren't just cars. They were symbols. Proof that women could succeed. Proof that recognition matters more than money.
        <br><br>
        3.5 million consultants. Billions in revenue. The woman they wouldn't promote built something bigger than all of them.
    </div>

    <div class="hook">She had no stores. No advertising budget. No investors. She had one thing: she would personally put cream on a stranger's face at a department store counter. Nobody could say no.</div>
    <div class="story">
        Lauder understood something profound: skin care is intimate. You can't describe how a cream feels. You have to feel it.
        <br><br>
        So she touched people. Literally. She'd approach women, apply product herself, massage it in. An intimate moment with a stranger.
        <br><br>
        She invented "gift with purchase." Buy one thing, get another free. It's now standard. She invented it.
        <br><br>
        At 80, she still worked the counters. Still touching faces. Still closing sales.
        <br><br>
        "Telephone, telegraph, tell a woman," she said. She understood word-of-mouth before it had a name.

    <span class="stat">$190B+ empire today</span>
    <div class="hook">At 52, Ray Kroc was a milkshake machine salesman. A failing one. Then he visited a hamburger stand that was using 8 of his machines at once. He had to know why.</div>
    <div class="story">
        The McDonald brothers had a system. Fast. Efficient. Consistent. Kroc saw it differently.
        <br><br>
        He didn't see hamburgers. He saw a business that could be copied. Everywhere.
        <br><br>
        He convinced the brothers to let him franchise it. Then he bought them out. For $2.7 million. They thought they'd won.
        <br><br>
        Kroc didn't sell food. He sold a turnkey business. Every franchisee was a customer buying a complete system.
        <br><br>
        Today: 40,000+ locations. $190 billion market cap. The milkshake machine salesman built it all because he knew what he was really selling.

    <div class="lesson">
        <strong>The Lesson</strong>
        <p>Don't sell the product—sell the system. The business model is the product.</p>

    <span class="stat">1,009 rejections</span>
    <div class="hook">He was 65 years old. Broke. His restaurant had just failed. His first Social Security check was $105. He used it to start selling fried chicken recipes out of his car. He was rejected 1,009 times.</div>

        A new highway bypassed Sanders' restaurant. Business died. At 65, he was done.

        But he had one thing: a fried chicken recipe people loved. So he got in his car and drove to restaurants.

        His pitch: "Let me cook chicken in your kitchen. If you like it, pay me 5 cents per chicken sold."
        <br><br>
        He slept in his car. Ate in diners. Got rejected. Over. And over. And over.
        <br><br>
        1,009 restaurants said no. Number 1,010 said yes.
        <br><br>
        By 1964, he had 600 franchises. He sold the company for $2 million and became the face of KFC until his death.
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
        <strong>The Lesson</strong>
        <p>1,009 rejections mean nothing if #1,010 says yes. Keep. Going.</p>

<div class="person">
    <div class="name">Ron Popeil</div>
    <div class="title">"The King of Infomercials" | 1935-2021</div>
    <span class="stat">$2B+ in sales</span>
    <div class="hook">"But wait, there's more!" Those four words made Ron Popeil a billionaire. He didn't invent the infomercial. He perfected it.</div>
    <div class="story">
        Popeil learned sales on Chicago's Maxwell Street, pitching to crowds. Every infomercial was that same pitch, broadcast to millions.
        <br><br>
        His formula was simple:<br>
        1. Show the problem<br>
        2. Demonstrate the solution<br>
        3. Stack the bonuses<br>
        4. Create urgency<br>
        5. Make it easy to buy
        <br><br>
        Veg-O-Matic. Pocket Fisherman. Showtime Rotisserie. Over $2 billion in sales. From a guy who started on a street corner.
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
        <strong>The Lesson</strong>
        <p>Selling is entertainment. Make it a show.</p>

<div class="person">
    <div class="name">Joe Ades</div>
    <div class="title">"The Gentleman Peeler" | 1934-2009</div>
    <div class="hook">He sold $5 vegetable peelers on the streets of Manhattan. He wore $2,000 Savile Row suits. He lived in a luxury apartment. He dined at the finest restaurants. From $5 peelers.</div>
    <div class="story">
        Joe Ades didn't sell peelers. He sold a performance.
        <br><br>
        "It'll julienne, it'll shred, it'll make a rose out of a tomato. Watch this!"
        <br><br>
        His British accent. His tailored suits. His theatrical flourishes. People didn't buy because they needed peelers. They bought because they wanted to have met Joe Ades.
        <br><br>
        He made millions. From $5 peelers. In Union Square.
        <br><br>
        His funeral drew hundreds. For a vegetable peeler salesman.
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
        <strong>The Lesson</strong>
        <p>People buy the experience, not the product. Charisma makes anything valuable.</p>

    <span class="stat">OxiClean, Mighty Putty, Kaboom</span>
    <div class="hook">He was the loudest man on television. People mocked him. Comedians parodied him. He didn't care. He was too busy selling $1 billion in products.</div>

        <br><br>
        That voice. That beard. That energy. You couldn't ignore him. That was the point.
        <br><br>
        Mays started on the Atlantic City Boardwalk. Same streets as Joe Ades. He learned that in a world of boring, energy wins.
        <br><br>
        His volume wasn't a gimmick. It was strategy. Attention is the first sale. If they don't notice you, they can't buy from you.
        <br><br>
        OxiClean alone did $1 billion. All because he refused to be ignored.
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
        <strong>The Lesson</strong>
        <p>Energy is contagious. Stand out by being impossible to ignore.</p>

<div class="person">
    <div class="name">King Camp Gillette</div>
    <div class="title">Founder, Gillette | 1855-1932</div>
    <div class="hook">He gave away 3.5 million razors for free. It was the most profitable decision in business history.</div>
    <div class="story">
        Gillette had a problem: his razors were too good. People only needed to buy one.
        <br><br>
        So he flipped the model. Sell razors cheap—or give them away. Make money on the blades.
        <br><br>
        During World War I, he gave a free razor to every American soldier. 3.5 million razors. 36 million blades.
        <br><br>
        When those soldiers came home, they were Gillette customers for life. Every one of them needed blades.
        <br><br>
        Today we call it "razor and blades." Printers/ink. Consoles/games. Keurig/pods. Gillette invented it.
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">

        <p>Give away the razor, sell the blades. Optimize for lifetime value.</p>

    <span class="stat">30 million copies sold</span>
    <div class="hook">He failed as an actor. Failed as a salesman. Failed as a novelist. At 24, he was teaching public speaking at a YMCA for $2 per class. That class became a 30-million-copy book.</div>
    <div class="story">
        Carnegie's principles seem obvious now. That's because he made them obvious.
        <br><br>
        Be genuinely interested in others. Smile. Remember names. Listen more than you talk. Make people feel important.
        <br><br>
        Before Carnegie, nobody had written this down. After Carnegie, every sales training program borrowed from him.
        <br><br>
        Warren Buffett credits Carnegie's course with transforming his life. He still has the certificate on his wall.
        <br><br>
        30 million copies. 89 years in print. The failed actor taught the world to sell.

    <div class="hook">Before he was the "Father of Advertising," he sold cooking stoves door-to-door in Scotland. The manual he wrote for that job was called "the finest sales instruction ever written" by Fortune magazine.</div>
    <div class="story">
        Ogilvy sold AGA cooking stoves. Big, expensive, complicated stoves. To skeptical Scottish housewives.
        <br><br>
        His rules: Don't sit until invited. Don't smoke unless offered. Never wear a hat. Study your customer's business.
        <br><br>
        And his most important rule: "The more you tell, the more you sell."
        <br><br>
        He brought these principles to advertising. Rolls-Royce: "At 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise comes from the electric clock." Long copy. Detailed facts. Respect for the reader's intelligence.
        <br><br>
        Ogilvy & Mather became one of the world's great agencies. All built on lessons from door-to-door sales.
    </div>

    <span class="stat">Millions attended his seminars</span>
    <div class="hook">He sold pots and pans door-to-door. He was mediocre. Then a manager told him he could be great. That belief changed everything.</div>
    <div class="story">
        Ziglar was struggling. Barely making quota. Ready to quit.
        <br><br>
        A regional manager saw something in him. Told him: "You could be a great one." Nobody had ever said that before.
        <br><br>
        Ziglar went from mediocre to national champion. Then he spent 50 years telling others the same thing: You can be great.
        <br><br>
        "You can have everything in life you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want."
        <br><br>
        That belief—that sales is about helping—made him the most beloved sales trainer in history.

        Benioff learned sales at Oracle. Larry Ellison told him: "You have a salesman's personality." He wasn't wrong.
        <br><br>
        At Salesforce, Benioff didn't sell software. He sold rebellion. "No Software" was the tagline. Software CDs were the enemy. Cloud was the future.
        <br><br>
        He staged fake protests outside Siebel conferences. He created an enemy and positioned Salesforce as the alternative.
        <br><br>
        Enterprise software became tribal. Emotional. Us vs. them. It wasn't supposed to work.
        <br><br>
        $200 billion market cap says otherwise.

    <span class="stat">Youngest self-made female billionaire</span>
    <div class="hook">She sold fax machines door-to-door for 7 years. Doors slammed in her face daily. Gates closed on her car. She was escorted out by security. It was the best training she ever got.</div>
    <div class="story">
        Blakely's fax machine territory was Florida. Hot. Humid. Nobody wanted to buy.
        <br><br>
        She learned to love rejection. To expect it. To push through it. Every "no" was practice for the next "yes."
        <br><br>
        When she invented Spanx, she cold-called Neiman Marcus. Got laughed at. Got a meeting anyway. Demonstrated the product in the bathroom—on herself.
        <br><br>
        She kept her fax machine job for two years after launching. Did her own PR. Hand-delivered products.
        <br><br>
        Youngest self-made female billionaire. All because door-to-door taught her that rejection is just practice.

    <div class="story">
        No fancy product. No technology. Just garbage bags and a kid who wanted basketball shoes.
        <br><br>
        Cuban learned the basics: find customers, make a pitch, handle rejection, close. He learned that nobody buys on the first visit. He learned to follow up.
        <br><br>
        Later, he got fired from a computer store for closing a deal instead of opening the store. He started his own company. Sold it for $6 million.
        <br><br>
        Then Broadcast.com. Sold to Yahoo for $5.7 billion.

    <div class="story">
        When her boyfriend left, he told her she'd never succeed without him.
        <br><br>
        Corcoran didn't get sad. She got competitive. She decided to build something bigger than anything he could imagine.
        <br><br>
        Her genius was PR. She created "The Corcoran Report"—a marketing piece disguised as market research. Newspapers quoted it. She staged newsworthy events. She manufactured attention.
        <br><br>
        "The difference between successful people and everyone else is that successful people just keep getting up."
        <br><br>

<h2>What They All Have in Common</h2>
<!-- ============================================== -->

<div class="lesson" style="margin-top: 48px;">
    <strong>1. They were rejected thousands of times</strong>
    <p>Sanders: 1,009 nos. Blakely: doors slammed daily. Corcoran: failed at 20 jobs. They kept going anyway.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson">
    <strong>2. They showed, not told</strong>
    <p>Fuller demonstrated brushes. Bissell swept carpets. Popeil peeled vegetables. The product in action sells itself.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson">
    <strong>3. They made it personal</strong>
    <p>Walker told her own story. Girard sent 13,000 cards monthly. Feidner spent hours listening. Relationships drive everything.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson">
    <strong>4. They sold the transformation</strong>
    <p>Feldman sold family protection. Mary Kay sold confidence. Blakely sold how you feel in your clothes. Outcomes, not features.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson">
    <strong>5. They gave first</strong>
    <p>Fuller gave free brushes. Gillette gave free razors. Lauder gave free samples. Reciprocity works.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson">
    <strong>6. They stood out</strong>
    <p>Billy Mays was loud. Joe Ades was elegant. Benioff was rebellious. In a world of boring, different wins.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson">
    <strong>7. They systemized success</strong>
    <p>Patterson created training. Watson built processes. Kroc franchised a system. The best salespeople are also the best teachers.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson">
    <strong>8. They saw sales as the ultimate skill</strong>
    <p>Every billionaire here—Cuban, Blakely, Kroc, Benioff—credits sales as their foundation. It unlocks everything else.</p>
