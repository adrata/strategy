## Cold Outreach (Email/LinkedIn)

### Subject Lines That Get Opened:
- "Quick question about [Company Name]'s notary process"
- "Saw you're hiring - scaling pains?"
- "47 notaries → 1 click"

### Email Template #1: Problem-Aware
```
Hi [Name],

Quick question - when a notary cancels 30 minutes before a closing, what's your backup plan?

Most title companies we work with were spending 10+ hours/week playing phone tag with notaries. Now they spend 20 minutes.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

Hi [Name],

Noticed [Company Name] is expanding. Congrats!

Quick question: How are you planning to handle 2x the volume without 2x the notary coordination headaches?
