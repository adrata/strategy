## The "Aha!" Moment Checklist

You know your demo worked when they say:
- [ ] "Wait, it does that automatically?"
- [ ] "How much does this cost again?"
- [ ] "Can we start tomorrow?"
- [ ] "I need to show this to [decision maker]"
- [ ] "Why didn't we do this sooner?"

## The Ultimate Demo Goal

**Don't make them think "That's cool."**
**Make them think "I NEED this."**

There's a difference. Cool is interesting. Need is urgent.

Every wow moment should move them from "cool" to "need."

---

**Remember**: Features tell. Benefits sell. Transformations close.
