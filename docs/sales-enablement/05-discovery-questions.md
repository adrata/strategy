# Discovery Question Frameworks
## Questions That Uncover Needs & Build Momentum

---

## The Golden Rule of Discovery

**You can't solve a problem they haven't admitted they have.**

Your job: Ask questions that make them realize they have a problem worth solving.

---

## Current State Assessment Questions

### Opening Questions:
- *"Walk me through your current notary coordination process from start to finish."*
- *"How many closings are you doing per month right now?"*
- *"Who on your team is responsible for notary scheduling?"*

### Digging Deeper:
- *"How much time would you say your team spends on notary coordination each week?"*
- *"What tools or systems are you currently using?"*
- *"How are you tracking notary performance and reliability?"*

### **The Power Move:**
After they describe their process, pause and say:
*"Interesting. And how's that working for you?"*

(They'll almost always reveal pain here)

---

## Pain Point Exploration Questions

### Uncovering Hidden Pain:
- *"What's the most frustrating part of your current process?"*
- *"When was the last time a notary let you down? What happened?"*
- *"If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about notary coordination, what would it be?"*

### Quantifying the Pain:
- *"How often does that happen? Daily? Weekly?"*
- *"What does that cost you when it happens?"*
- *"How does that impact your team's morale?"*

### The Amplification Questions:
- *"What happens if you don't fix this?"*
- *"How long have you been dealing with this?"*
- *"Is it getting better or worse?"*

### **The Power Move:**
*"So if I'm hearing you right, you're spending [X hours] per week, dealing with [Y cancellations] per month, and it's costing you roughly [Z dollars] per year. Is that accurate?"*

(Make them say "yes" to their own pain)

## Vision & Goals Questions

### Future-Focused:
- *"Where do you want to be 12 months from now?"*
- *"What would success look like for your operation?"*
- *"If you could handle 2x the volume, what would that mean for your business?"*

### Gap Analysis:
- *"What's stopping you from getting there?"*
- *"What would need to change for that to happen?"*
- *"If notary coordination wasn't an issue, what would you focus on instead?"*

### **The Power Move:**
*"So you want to grow from [X] to [Y] closings, but notary coordination is the bottleneck. What if that bottleneck just... disappeared?"*

---

## Decision-Making Process Questions

### Understanding the Buying Process:
- *"Who else would need to be involved in a decision like this?"*
- *"What's your typical process for evaluating new solutions?"*
- *"Have you looked at other options? What did you think?"*

### Timeline & Urgency:
- *"When are you looking to have a solution in place?"*
- *"What's driving that timeline?"*
- *"What happens if you wait another 6 months?"*

### Budget & Investment:
- *"What are you currently spending on notary services per month?"*
- *"If I could show you a 300% ROI, would budget be an issue?"*
- *"What would you need to see to justify the investment?"*

### **The Power Move:**
*"So if this solves [pain point], saves you [X dollars], and you can see ROI in [Y months], what would stop you from moving forward?"*

(Flush out objections early)

---

## Urgency & Priority Questions

### Creating Urgency:
- *"On a scale of 1-10, how urgent is solving this problem?"*
- *"What happens if you don't solve this in the next 90 days?"*
- *"How much is this costing you every month you wait?"*

### Prioritization:
- *"Where does this rank on your priority list?"*
- *"What else are you working on right now?"*
- *"If you could only fix one operational issue this quarter, would this be it?"*

### **The Power Move:**
*"You mentioned this is costing you [X] per month. So every month you wait is another [X] dollars out the door. What's the cost of doing nothing?"*

## The Question Sequence That Closes Deals

Follow this exact order:

### 1. Current State (Build Rapport)
*"Walk me through your current process..."*

### 2. Pain Discovery (Uncover Problems)
*"What's the most frustrating part?"*

### 3. Quantification (Make It Real)
*"How much time/money is that costing you?"*

### 4. Amplification (Make It Urgent)
*"What happens if you don't fix this?"*

### 5. Vision (Show Possibility)
*"What would success look like?"*

### 6. Gap Analysis (Position Your Solution)
*"What's stopping you from getting there?"*

### 7. Decision Process (Remove Obstacles)
*"Who else needs to be involved?"*

### 8. Commitment (Trial Close)
*"If this solves [pain], what would stop you from moving forward?"*

---

## Advanced Question Techniques

### The Assumptive Question:
Instead of: *"Do you have problems with notary coordination?"*
Ask: *"How are you currently handling notary coordination?"*
(Assumes they're doing it, just asks how)

### The Comparison Question:
*"How does your current process compare to what you'd consider ideal?"*
(Makes them articulate the gap)

### The Consequence Question:
*"What's the impact on your business if this continues?"*
(Future-paces the pain)

### The Permission Question:
*"Can I ask you a tough question?"*
(Disarms them, makes them curious)

### The Reflection Question:
*"So what I'm hearing is [summarize their pain]. Is that right?"*
(Makes them re-confirm their own pain)

## Questions to Avoid

❌ "Are you happy with your current solution?"
(They'll say "it's fine")

❌ "Would you like to see a demo?"
(Too early, no pain established)

❌ "What's your budget?"
(Sounds like you're selling, not helping)

❌ "Can I send you some information?"
(Death sentence for the deal)

## The "Wow, They're Selling Themselves" Moment

You know you're doing discovery right when:
- They're talking 70% of the time
