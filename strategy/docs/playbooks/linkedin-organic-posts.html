        <h2>The Content Strategy</h2>
        
        <p>Most LinkedIn content fails because it's either too salesy or too generic. The VP Sales you're targeting sees 47 posts before breakfast. They scroll past anything that smells like marketing.</p>
        
        <p>What stops them? Content that names their specific fear. Content that proves you understand what keeps them up at 2 AM. Content that makes them think: "This person gets it."</p>

        <div class="strategy-box">
            <h3>The Content Mix</h3>

Not psychic. Just 3 signals that predict slippage with 87% accuracy:

1. Champion Availability
Can you get a meeting in 72 hours?
If NO → 73% slip rate.
Champions who are "too busy" are avoiding you.

2. Next Step Specificity
Is it a specific action with a specific person on a specific date?
If vague → 68% slip rate.
"We'll reconnect next week" = not real.

3. Decision Maker Engagement
Has the economic buyer participated in 14 days?
If NO → 81% slip rate.

Score it:
→ 3/3 = Committed
→ 2/3 = At Risk
→ 1/3 = Will Slip
→ 0/3 = Already Dead

You just don't know it yet.

I call them "zombie deals"—they look alive in Salesforce, but they'll never close.

5 questions to kill every zombie:

1. When was your last 2-way communication?
(Not your email TO them—their response)
21+ days of silence = Zombie

2. Has the deal stage changed in 30 days?
Same stage for 30+ days = Zombie

3. Do you have the decision-maker's mobile number?
No? You don't have a real relationship.

4. Can you explain WHY they would buy NOW vs. next quarter?
If you can't articulate their urgency, it doesn't exist.

5. If you called your champion right now, would they answer?
If you hesitated... you know the truth.

Run these 5 questions on your top 10 deals.
Kill every zombie.

Most VP Sales use 15 slides. The best use 3.

More slides = more questions = more chances to look uncertain.

Slide 1: THE NUMBER
• Target vs. Actual (big and clear)
• Attainment %
• Trend line
• One sentence: why

NOT: Every deal, activity metrics, excuses.

Slide 2: THE PIPELINE
• Coverage ratio
• Weighted vs. unweighted
• Quality indicator
• One sentence: what's real

NOT: Every deal, stage breakdowns.

Slide 3: THE PLAN
• Top 3 priorities this quarter
• One risk you're watching
• One ask if needed

NOT: 10 initiatives, problems without solutions.

The board doesn't want more data.
They want confidence.

3 slides. 10 minutes.

We lost the deal.

What happened?

She liked me. She believed in our product. But she didn't have the power, the will, or the political capital to push it through.

She was a contact pretending to be a champion.

And I fell for it.

The difference between a champion and a friendly contact?

Champions close deals.
Contacts waste your time.

Here's how to tell:

→ Will they give you access to the decision-maker?
→ Will they tell you the uncomfortable truth?
→ Will they sell for you when you're not in the room?
→ Will they fight when someone pushes back?
→ Will they stake their reputation on you?

If you hesitated on any of those... you don't have a champion.

You have a friend who can't help you close.</div>

            <div class="post-content">The email arrives at 6:47 AM.

Subject: Q4 Kickoff - Mandatory - Today 9am.

Three lines from the CEO:
"Emergency leadership meeting. Boardroom. 9am sharp. We need to discuss Q4 targets. I've reviewed the numbers."

Then, ominously: "Clear your calendars."

I know what this means.

$18.4M target. $4.2M in pipeline. 23% coverage.

Industry standard is 3-4x. I have 0.23x.

The gap isn't concerning. It's mathematically impossible.

But here's what I learned walking into that room:

The board doesn't fire you for missing a number.
They fire you for not knowing why.

That meeting forced me to audit every deal.
To ask: "Who else needs to say yes?"
To face the uncomfortable truth: I was betting on champions who couldn't close.

Sometimes the worst meeting of your career
becomes the best thing that happened to you.

            <div class="post-content">Early in my career, I spent weeks trying to "create urgency" in deals that had none.

Limited time offers.
Quarterly pricing.
"I can only hold this spot until..."

It rarely worked.
And when it did, I felt gross.

Then I discovered something that changed everything:

I can't create urgency that doesn't exist.
But I can find it where it's hiding.

The PULL framework:

P — Project
Is this an active project on their to-do list?
(Not "would be nice"—actively being worked on NOW)

U — Urgency
Is there a reason they need to solve this NOW?
Deadline? Pain event? Executive mandate?

L — Limitations
Are their current options inadequate?
Status quo not working? DIY not viable?

L — Leap
Can they actually buy?
Budget exists? Decision-maker engaged?

Score it:
4/4 = High PULL → pursue aggressively
3/4 = Medium PULL → qualify harder
2/4 = Low PULL → nurture
0-1/4 = No PULL → disqualify

Stop manufacturing urgency.
Start finding where it already exists.</div>

"Multi-threading" is taught completely wrong.

Everyone says: "Get to more stakeholders."

But here's what actually happens:

→ You have 1 champion
→ You ask for more introductions
→ Champion says "I'll handle it internally"
→ You never meet anyone else
→ Deal stalls
→ You lose

The problem isn't that you didn't multi-thread.
The problem is you trusted someone who couldn't close.

The real skill isn't getting more meetings.
It's identifying WHO can actually close the deal—
and building relationships with THEM.

Sometimes that's your champion.
Often it's not.

Multi-threading without champion validation
is just organized failure.

            <div class="post-content">The worst sales advice I ever received:

"Always be closing."

I spent years trying to close harder.
Pushing on deals that weren't ready.
Creating urgency that didn't exist.
Burning relationships for short-term wins.

Then I watched a Steinway salesperson outsell everyone by 3x.

Her secret?

She never tried to close.

When customers came in, most salespeople showed pianos.
She had them sit down and play for an hour.
She asked about their lives.
She listened.

Sometimes she'd say: "You don't need what we have here."

The customers who stayed?
They bought the most expensive piano in the showroom.

ABC isn't about closing.
It's about alignment.

Always be understanding.
Always be helping.
Always be matching.

The close happens when it's right.
Not when you're pushing.</div>

            <div class="post-content">Controversial take:

Most VP Sales are solving the wrong problem.

They think: "We need more pipeline."

But here's what the data shows:

→ Average close rate: 20-25%
→ Top performers: 35-40%

That's a 2x gap. Same pipeline.

The difference isn't quantity.
It's deal quality and execution.

What if instead of chasing more pipeline,
you disqualified faster and closed harder?

I studied 847 enterprise deals.

The biggest predictor of close?
Not pipeline size.
Not activity volume.
Not even product fit.

It was this:

How well did the rep understand the full buying committee?

Teams that mapped 4+ stakeholders closed at 2.4x the rate
of teams that relied on a single champion.

More pipeline won't save you.
Better deals will.

Here's what separates the deals that close from the ones that die:

Stakeholders mapped:
→ 1-2 stakeholders: 18% close rate
→ 3-4 stakeholders: 31% close rate
→ 5+ stakeholders: 44% close rate

That's a 2.4x improvement just from knowing who's involved.

But here's the part that surprised me:

The CFO was involved in the decision 73% of the time.
But sales reps only engaged the CFO 22% of the time.

That's a 51-point gap.

The single biggest predictor of deal slippage?

Not price. Not product fit. Not timing.

It was this: Whether the economic buyer was engaged in the last 14 days.

81% slip rate when they weren't.

Not my opinion. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions research.

Here's why it works:

When a prospect sees your ad cold:
→ Baseline conversion

When they've seen your content first:
→ You're not a stranger
→ They've seen your name
→ Trust is established

The difference?
The ad is reinforcement, not introduction.

What this means for your team:

→ Content isn't separate from demand gen
→ Your personal LinkedIn is a revenue channel
→ Warm DMs convert 10x better than cold

The best sales leaders I know post 2-3x/week.

Not because they're "building a personal brand."

Because it makes everything else work better.

Your ad costs go down.
Your response rates go up.
Your close rates improve.

Same budget. Better results.

But here's what most people miss:

"Cold" calling doesn't have to be cold.

A prospect who:
→ Saw your ad
→ Engaged with your content
→ Then gets a call?

That's warm.

And warm beats cold 10x.

The best SDR teams I've seen aren't making more calls.
They're making better calls.

They're calling people who already know who they are.

The math:
→ 100 cold calls × 2.3% = 2.3 conversations
→ 30 warm calls × 15% = 4.5 conversations

Half the effort. Double the result.

Cold calling isn't dead.
But cold-only calling is dying.

        <h2>Posting Strategy</h2>

        <div class="tip">
            <strong>Timing</strong>
            <p>Best times: Tuesday-Wednesday, 10 AM - 12 PM. Avoid Monday morning (inbox overload) and Friday afternoon (weekend mindset).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <strong>Cadence</strong>
            <p>Minimum: 2-3 posts per week. Optimal: 4-5 posts per week. Consistency beats frequency—better to post 2x reliably than 5x inconsistently.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <strong>Format Priority</strong>
            <p>Video > Carousel > Text with image > Text only. But text-only contrarian posts often outperform everything else. Match format to content type.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <strong>The Golden Rule</strong>
            <p>Every post should pass this test: "Would a VP of Sales screenshot this and send it to their team?" If yes, post it. If no, keep refining.</p>
