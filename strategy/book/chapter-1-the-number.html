<div class="doc-type">Q4: A Novel</div>
<h1>Chapter 1: The Number</h1>
<div class="subtitle">Monday, October 5, 2026</div>

<p>The email arrives at 6:47 AM.</p>

<p>I'm already awake. I've been awake since 4:30, running the numbers in my head for the hundredth time. $18.4 million. That's the Q4 target the board approved. $18.4 million in new bookings across 88 days. Simple math: $209,000 per day. Every day. Including weekends. Including Thanksgiving. Including the two weeks in December when every enterprise buyer in America goes dark.</p>

<p>The numbers haven't changed overnight. They never do.</p>

<p>I reach for my phone. The notification is from Marco Valenti, our CEO. Subject line: <em>Q4 Kickoff - Mandatory - Today 9am.</em></p>

<p>The body is three lines: "Emergency leadership meeting. Boardroom. 9am sharp. We need to discuss Q4 targets and current trajectory. I've reviewed the numbers."</p>

<p>Then, ominously: "Clear your calendars."</p>

<p>I've been at VeloCloud for three years. VP of Enterprise Sales for the last eighteen months. I built this team from scratch. I know what "clear your calendars" means when it comes from Marco at 6:47 in the morning.</p>

<p>I swing my legs out of bed and walk to the window. San Francisco is wrapped in fog, the Salesforce Tower half-swallowed by gray. Somewhere out there, fourteen Account Executives are still sleeping, unaware that their VP is about to walk into a meeting that will determine whether they still have jobs by Christmas.</p>

<div class="scene-break">* * *</div>

<p>The numbers. I stare at them on my laptop as I drink my coffee.</p>

<div class="dashboard">
    <div class="metric-card">
        <div class="label">Q3 Attainment</div>
        <div class="number danger">67%</div>
        <div class="change negative">Down from 89% in Q1</div>
    </div>
    <div class="metric-card">
        <div class="label">Q4 Target</div>
        <div class="number">$18.4M</div>
        <div class="change">Board approved</div>
    </div>
    <div class="metric-card">
        <div class="label">Current Pipeline</div>
        <div class="number danger">$4.2M</div>
        <div class="change negative">23% coverage</div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>To hit $18.4 million, I need roughly $55 million in qualified pipeline. Industry standard is 3x to 4x coverage. We have $4.2 million. The coverage ratio isn't just bad—it's mathematically impossible.</p>

<p>I try to remember how it felt fourteen months ago. President's Club in Maui. Marco called me a "franchise player" at the all-hands, one hand on my shoulder, the whole company applauding. We had closed 112% of target that year. I remember thinking: <em>I've figured this out. I understand how enterprise sales works.</em></p>

<p>Now I'm not sure I understand anything.</p>

<p>Q1 of this year: 89%. Concerning, but explainable. Market tightening. Budget freezes. Normal stuff, I told myself.</p>

<p>Q2: 78%. The board started asking questions. Marco stopped making eye contact in the hallway.</p>

<p>Q3: 67%. Marco stopped smiling in our one-on-ones. The conversations got shorter. More pointed. Last week, he asked me to "walk him through the pipeline" for the third time in ten days.</p>

<p>And now Q4. The quarter that determines bonuses, board confidence, whether we raise our Series C or become another cautionary tale in the tech press.</p>

<p>I'm walking into that boardroom with $4.2 million against $18.4 million.</p>

<p>They're going to fire me.</p>

<p>The thought lands in my chest like a stone. I grip my coffee mug and force myself to breathe.</p>

<div class="scene-break">* * *</div>

<p>I arrive at the office at 8:30. The floor is mostly empty—most of my team doesn't show up until 9:30 or 10. I walk past the rows of empty desks to my office, trying to project confidence I don't feel.</p>

<p>Matteo Ricci catches me in the hallway. He's my top AE—$3.2 million closed last year, natural relationship builder, the kind of rep who makes enterprise sales look easy.</p>

<p>"Hey, Nico. You got a sec? I wanted to talk about Garrison."</p>

<p>Garrison Financial. Our biggest opportunity. $2.1 million total contract value. Matteo has been working it for four months. It's the deal I'm counting on to save Q4.</p>

<p>"After the leadership meeting," I tell him. "Can you pull together an update? Full status. Where we are, what's left, timeline."</p>

<p>His smile falters almost imperceptibly. "Yeah, sure. Everything's on track. Adrian—their CTO—he's totally bought in. Says we're his top choice. Just need to get through procurement."</p>

<p>"Just need to get through procurement." I've heard that phrase a hundred times. It's meant to sound like a minor formality. It usually isn't.</p>

<p>"Get me the update," I say. "Everything. Call notes. Email threads. The works."</p>

<p>He nods and walks away. I notice he doesn't look me in the eye either.</p>

<div class="scene-break">* * *</div>

<p>The boardroom. 8:58 AM.</p>

<p>Marco is already seated at the head of the table, his laptop open in front of him. Sofia Chen, our CFO, sits to his right, a spreadsheet glowing on her screen that I can see from the doorway. Dante Rossi, my boss—the CRO—is across from her, arms crossed, expression unreadable.</p>

<p>I take the empty seat next to Dante. The chair feels harder than usual.</p>

<p>"Let's start," Marco says. No pleasantries. He clicks, and my pipeline chart fills the screen behind him. It looks like a cliff face dropping into an ocean.</p>

<p>"Three days into Q4. We have $4.2 million in qualified pipeline against an $18.4 million target. That's 23% coverage." He pauses, letting the number hang in the air. "Industry standard is 3x to 4x. We need $55 to $75 million to have a realistic shot. We have $4.2 million."</p>

<p>I start to speak. "The market has—"</p>

<p>"The gap has been widening for three consecutive quarters," Sofia cuts in, not unkindly. She pulls up a trend line. "Q1, Q2, Q3. Attainment declining. Pipeline declining. New logos down 34% year over year. Average deal velocity has slowed from 47 days to 89 days. Win rates against Meridian and Stratos are down to 31%."</p>

<p>The numbers hit me like body blows. She's not wrong. But hearing them laid out like an autopsy report makes something tighten in my chest.</p>

<p>"Every enterprise software company is seeing longer cycles," I manage. "Buyers are more cautious. Procurement is more involved. The macro environment—"</p>

<p>"Meridian grew 42% last quarter." Marco's voice is flat. "Stratos just raised $200 million at a $2.4 billion valuation. They're not struggling with buyer caution, Nico. The macro environment isn't stopping them."</p>

<p>I have no response. I've told myself the same story—market conditions, headwinds, budget freezes—for months. But the competitors are thriving. The story doesn't hold up.</p>

<p>"Here's where we are," Marco continues. "The board meets in eleven weeks. If we don't hit at least 85% of Q4 target, we're looking at a down round. Or worse."</p>

<p>He pauses. Lets that sink in.</p>

<p>"VeloCloud has eighteen months of runway at current burn. A miss of this magnitude changes everything. Layoffs. Down round. Maybe acquisition at a fire-sale price."</p>

<p>The room is silent. I think about my team. Fourteen AEs. Six SDRs. Twenty people with mortgages, kids, careers built on trust in my leadership. Twenty people who took this job because I recruited them, told them we were building something special.</p>

<p>"What do you need from me?" I ask. My voice comes out quieter than I intended.</p>

<p>Marco and Dante exchange a look I can't read.</p>

<p>"That's what we're here to figure out," Dante says. "Walk us through your top five deals. Stage by stage. What's real, what's at risk, and what needs to happen for them to close."</p>

<div class="scene-break">* * *</div>

<p>For the next ninety minutes, I walk them through the pipeline. Every major opportunity. Every stage. Every risk.</p>

<p>Garrison Financial: $2.1M. "Strong champion in the CTO. Final procurement review."</p>

<p>Nexus Logistics: $890K. "Technical validation complete. Negotiating terms."</p>

<p>Atlas Healthcare: $1.1M. "Pilot successful. Waiting on budget approval."</p>

<p>Three more deals. Same pattern. I have champions. I have interest. I have verbal commitments.</p>

<p>What I don't have, I realize as I'm saying it out loud, is visibility into what's actually happening inside these companies. I know my contacts. I believe my contacts. But I suddenly realize I have almost no idea who else is involved in these decisions, what they think, or what obstacles are forming in rooms I've never entered.</p>

<p>Sofia asks the question that breaks something open in my mind.</p>

<p>"On the Garrison deal—the $2.1 million one—who besides the CTO has to approve this purchase?"</p>

<p>I pause. "Adrian is the decision maker."</p>

<p>"The CTO makes $2.1 million purchase decisions alone at a 4,000-person financial services company?"</p>

<p>I open my mouth. Close it.</p>

<p>"I'd have to check the org chart," I say finally.</p>

<p>Sofia doesn't respond. She doesn't have to.</p>

<p>Marco stands. The meeting is over.</p>

<p>"I want a revised plan by Friday," he says. "Not a forecast. A plan. Show me you understand what's actually happening in these deals and what it will take to close them. If you can't do that—" He doesn't finish the sentence. He doesn't need to.</p>

<div class="scene-break">* * *</div>

<p>I walk back to my office in a daze. Through the glass walls, I can see my team now—Matteo is at his desk, headphones on, probably listening to a call recording. Three SDRs are huddled around a whiteboard, planning the week's outreach.</p>

<p>They look up as I pass. A few nod. They're waiting for me to set the tone, the direction, the energy for Q4 kickoff.</p>

<p>I close my office door and sit at my desk.</p>

<p>Sofia's question echoes in my head: <em>Who besides the CTO has to approve this?</em></p>

<p>I pull up the Garrison deal record in Salesforce. One primary contact: Adrian Marchetti, CTO. Three meetings logged. Four months of activity. $2.1 million on the line.</p>

<p>I open Gong and find the call recordings. Seven calls over four months. I press play on the most recent one.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes in, I hear it. Adrian's voice: <em>"This looks great. I'm really excited about this. But you know how it is—I'll need to get buy-in from a few folks. Legal will want to see the security review. Finance will have questions about the ROI model. And honestly, Elena in procurement can be... particular. But don't worry about all that. I'll handle it internally."</em></p>

<p><em>Don't worry about all that. I'll handle it internally.</em></p>

<p>I've heard this phrase hundreds of times in my career. From dozens of "champions." I always took it as reassurance. Now, for the first time, I hear it for what it really is: a warning.</p>

<p>Adrian isn't the decision maker. Adrian is one voice in a conversation we're not part of.</p>

<p>I pull up the rest of our pipeline. Nexus Logistics: one contact. Atlas Healthcare: one contact. Deal after deal after deal—all built on single relationships with single people who claim they can "handle it internally."</p>

<p>My phone buzzes. Text from my wife: <em>How'd the meeting go?</em></p>

<p>I stare at the message for a long moment. How do I explain that three years of work might be collapsing because of something I can suddenly see but don't know how to fix?</p>

<p>My entire pipeline—$4.2 million of supposed opportunity—might be built on nothing but hope and assumption.</p>

<p>I look out the window at the San Francisco skyline. Somewhere in those buildings are the people who will actually decide whether my deals close or die. CFOs who control budgets. Procurement teams who assess vendors. Security officers who approve integrations. Legal teams who redline contracts. Executives I've never met, never spoken to, never even thought about.</p>

<p>And I have 88 days to find them.</p>

<p>My phone buzzes again. This time it's my calendar: <em>Matteo Ricci - Garrison update - 2:00pm.</em></p>

<p>I close my laptop and sit in silence.</p>

<p>For the first time in months, I don't feel just fear. I feel something else underneath it—something that might be the beginning of clarity. The beginning of a question.</p>

<p>If Adrian can't close this deal alone—and he can't—then who else needs to say yes?</p>

<p>And what happens when I finally ask?</p>
